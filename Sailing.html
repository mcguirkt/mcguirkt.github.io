			<p>During this pandemic I decided on giving something new a try when it is 
			all over having allready achieved my open water certificate in
			<a href="Scuba.html">Scuba Diving</a> and passing my <a href="Motorbike.html">
			Motorbike</a> licence. See my other pages. Having researched  thoroughly on what
			was available around scotland I found that Scotsail is the closest and widley
			regarded as the best place to start to learn.</p>

			<p class='class1'>One of the biggest costs in sailing after the yacht, is the 
			foul weather gear aka "fouly's". there is a good range of different manufactures
			and ranges within them. from light waeter wear through to deep blue ocean gear.
			as most of my sailing will be taking place around the west coast of scotland i 
			went with a topish of the range gear in the form of the henri lloyd elite 
			offshore set from
			<a href="https://www.force4.co.uk/item/Henri-Lloyd/Offshore-Elite-Suit-Deal-Black/WDT">Force4</a>. 
			which should be sufficent for the time being.</p>
